Problem Statement
Price of a property is one of the most important decision criterion when people buy homes. Real state firms need to be consistent in their pricing in order to attract buyers . Having a predictive model for the same will be great tool to have , which in turn can also be used to tweak development of properties , putting more emphasis on qualities which increase the value of the property.

We have given you two datasets , housing_train.csv and housing_test.csv . You need to use data housing_train.csv to build predictive model for response variable "Price". housing_test.csv data contains all other factors except "Price", you need to predict that using the model that you developed and submit your predicted values in a csv files.

Evaluation Criterion :
Score will be calculated as:
Score = 212467/RMSE (Note : Don't worry about change in scoring method , this is just a cosmetic change to alter scale of score , passing criterion hasn't changed and you don't need to resubmit )

Where RMSE is root mean square error on test file.
